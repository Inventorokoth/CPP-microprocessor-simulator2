# CPP-microprocessor-simulator
CPP simulation for a microprocessor with concurrent execution and networking capabilities.


CPP simulation of Microprocessor with the concurrent execution and networking capabilities. The microprocessor, which we call Simple Integer Machine (SIM), doesnâ€™t have registers but has two memory banks. The first is an instruction memory. It contains 1024 memory locations each capable of holding one instruction. The second, a data memory, also contains 1024 memory locations each capable of holding one integer value. 

The input will be a text file containing the instructions. Instructions start with a 3 character instruction word at the beginning, like ADD, followed by a single space, then a list of space-separated operands. The number of operands depends on the instruction. There exists a newline character after each instruction. We read this text file at the beginning of the simulation and convert each instruction to a representation that we store in the instruction memory. This representation uses C++ classes.
